BrowserPad
==========

Notepad for browsers using HTML+CSS+JS. Fully client side (offline mode).

The concept was inspired by [this Lifehacker post][lifehacker],
and originally conceived by [@jjperezaguinaga](https://github.com/jjperezaguinaga)
on his post "[One line browser notepad][original]".

To use it, just drag the following link:
**[BrowserPad](data:text/html, <html contenteditable>)**
to your browser's bookmark bar.

If you're on Firefox, you can check the "Load this bookmark in the sidebar" checkbox
so that you can continue browsing normally while taking notes.
